Slope between (1,1) and (2,2):

m1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
m1 = (2 - 1) / (2 - 1)
m1 = 1 / 1
m1 = 1

Slope between (1,1) and (x,y):

m2 = (y - 1) / (x - 1)

Slope between (2,2) and (x,y):

m3 = (y - 2) / (x - 2)

For all three points to be collinear, the slopes m1, m2, and m3 should be equal. Therefore:

m1 = m2 = m3

So, we have:

1 = (y - 1) / (x - 1) = (y - 2) / (x - 2)

Now, we can set up a system of equations:

(y - 1) / (x - 1) = 1
(y - 2) / (x - 2) = 1
Solve this system to find the possible values of (x, y) that satisfy these equations:

From the first equation
y - 1 = x - 1
y = x

From the second equation
y - 2 = x - 2
y = x

Both equations lead to the same result: y = x. This means that any point (x, y) where y = x will be collinear with (1,1) and (2,2). So, the possible coordinates of (x, y) are (a, a) where a can be any real number. For example, (3,3), (4,4), (-1,-1), (-2,-2), and so on, are all points that are collinear with (1,1) and (2,2).

To find all possible values of a and b for which the ratio of a^3 + b^3 to a^3 - b^3 is 1:1, we can set up the equation:

(a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1

Now, let's simplify this equation:

(a^3 + b^3) = (a^3 - b^3)

Next, let's move the (a^3 - b^3) term to the left side of the equation:

a^3 + b^3 - a^3 + b^3 = 0

Now, simplify further:

2b^3 = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

b^3 = 0

To find the possible values of b, take the cube root of both sides:

b = 0

So, the only possible value for b is 0.

Now that we know b = 0, we can go back to the original equation:

(a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1

Substitute b = 0:

(a^3 + 0) / (a^3 - 0) = 1

Simplify:

a^3 / a^3 = 1

a^3 / a^3 simplifies to 1 as long as a is not equal to 0 (since dividing by 0 is undefined).

Therefore, for all real numbers a â‰  0 and b = 0, the ratio of a^3 + b^3 to a^3 - b^3 is 1:1.

The line y = x intersects the y-axis at (0, 0).
The line y = x intersects the line y = 3 at the point where x = 3, so the coordinates of this point are (3, 3).
The y-axis intersects the line y = 3 at the point (0, 3).
Now, we have the vertices of the triangle:

A(0, 0), B(3, 3), and C(0, 3).

To find the area of the triangle, you can use the formula for the area of a triangle when you have the coordinates of its vertices. Let's use the formula:

Area = (1/2) * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|

Substitute the coordinates of the vertices:

Area = (1/2) * |0(3 - 3) + 3(3 - 0) + 0(0 - 3)|

Area = (1/2) * |0 + 9 + 0|

Area = (1/2) * |9|

Area = (1/2) * 9

Area = 9/2

So, the area of the triangle formed by the lines y = x, y-axis, and y = 3 is 9/2 square units.
